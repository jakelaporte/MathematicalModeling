        "This code produces nothing yet, but it is structured so that we can use it to carry out the simulation. The next thing that we initialize is two data structures that will assist us in answering questions in which we are interested. The first one has to do with the average number of customers in the system. We can answer this if we have the steady state proportion of times that we are in each state. This means that we need to keep track of the amount of time that we are in each state. There is an issue that we have not dealt with before in that there is not a pre-defined number of states that we have to stay - in this problem there can be an infinite number of people in our queueing system. So we will create a function that will do one of two things depending on if the state is currently in the system. If it is in the system, then it will add the time (dT) to the amount of time already accumulated; if the system has never encountered the state, then it will create a new row and let the total amount of time in the state be dT."
